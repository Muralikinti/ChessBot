# Self-Learning Chess Engine

A complete chess application featuring both traditional AI and modern neural network-powered gameplay. Built from scratch in Python with multiple AI opponents ranging from classic minimax to cutting-edge Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by deep neural networks.

## üéÆ Features

- **Complete Chess Implementation**: Full rule support including castling, en passant, pawn promotion, and draw conditions
- **Multiple AI Opponents**:
  - Traditional minimax with alpha-beta pruning
  - MCTS with random neural network weights  
  - MCTS with trained neural network (AlphaZero-style)
- **Self-Play Training**: Neural network learns through reinforcement learning
- **Interactive GUI**: Clean pygame interface with move highlighting and real-time analysis
- **Performance Comparison**: Switch between AI modes to compare playing strength

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pygame torch numpy matplotlib
```

### Run the Game
```bash
# Classic version (minimax AI)
python play_classic.py

# Advanced version (neural network AI with mode selection)
python play_advanced.py

# Train your own neural network
python train.py
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
- **`ChessEngine.py`**: Game rules, move generation, and traditional minimax AI
- **`chess_neural_network.py`**: PyTorch neural network for position evaluation
- **`mcts.py`**: Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation
- **`train.py`**: Self-play training pipeline

### Entry Points
- **`play_classic.py`**: Original game with minimax AI
- **`play_advanced.py`**: Enhanced interface with AI mode selection

## üß† Technical Implementation

### Neural Network Architecture
- **Input**: 8√ó8√ó12 board representation (piece types √ó colors)
- **Architecture**: Convolutional residual network with dual heads
- **Outputs**: Position evaluation (-1 to +1) + move probabilities (4096 possible moves)

### MCTS Algorithm
1. **Selection**: Navigate tree using UCB1 + neural network priors
2. **Expansion**: Add new nodes for legal moves  
3. **Evaluation**: Use neural network for position assessment
4. **Backup**: Propagate values up the tree

### Training Process
- Generate games through MCTS self-play
- Collect (board state, move probabilities, game outcome) tuples
- Train network to minimize value + policy losses
- Iteratively improve through reinforcement learning


## üéØ Usage Examples

### Playing Against Different AIs
Launch `play_advanced.py` and use the AI mode selector to switch between:
- Traditional minimax search
- MCTS with random neural network
- MCTS with trained neural network

### Training Your Own Model
```python
from train import SelfPlayTrainer

trainer = SelfPlayTrainer(batch_size=32, learning_rate=0.001)
trainer.self_play_training_loop(num_games=500, training_interval=10)
```

### Using Components in Your Code
```python
from mcts import MCTSPlayer
from ChessEngine import GameState

game = GameState()
ai_player = MCTSPlayer(simulations=400)
best_move = ai_player.get_move(game)
```
